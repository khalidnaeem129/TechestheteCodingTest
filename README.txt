Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php





What I expect:

A. A readme with:

1.  Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting. Logic.. 
		- Code should be use laravel core function not PHP function
		- Use midelwares for autherization
		- Reduce Less if else condition
		- Unnecessary variable define
		- Model related work should be in Models or Repository
		- Reduce the code replication use common function for common functionality
	
2.  Refactor it if you feel it needs formatting. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses.  

	 - Controller class code refactor
	 - In Model class add comments

Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes.
